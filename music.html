      <h1>Music that I Like</h1>
      <p>I am a massive fan of all kinds of electronic music. From Dubstep to Chicago House, Hardstyle to Eurobeat, and all the myriad sub-genres in between. I'm always looking to expand my playlists and fill my life with more tracks to keep things feeling good or to support my mood when working, studying or playing.</p>
      <p>Here is just a tiny sliver of the songs I reguarly listen to.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="song1">
      <h3>Professional Griefers by deadmau5 ft. Gerard Way</h3>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr2Bc5qMhE4"></iframe>
      <p>The above track combines the style of deadmau5 with the vocals of Gerard Way from My Chemical Romace to create a track that I listen to when I need something loud to release any angst or intense feelings. I was well versed with deadmau5's music but this track was the first expose I had to anything My Chemical Romance related, allowing me to expand my tastes and see bands I wasen't interested in at first and learn to appreciate and even love listening to as well.</p>

      <h3> Thunder by Gabry Ponte x LUM!X x Prezioso</h3>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdzHlbFItlw"></iframe>
      <p>This track is a favorite of my closest friend. Coming about from the time where sea shanties became a popular genre of music due to popular use in meme culture, this song combines the whimsy of a piratey tune with electric beats to make a party track that gets stuck in my head when I feel like having fun and in high spirits.</p>

      <h3>Lose Yourself to Dance by Daft Punk</h3>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NF-kLy44Hls"></iframe>
      <p>I cannot have a couple favorite songs listed without putting the legendary robot duo on that list somewhere. This track from the last studio album by Daft Punk is actually a track I use to test new headphones for surround sound and audio quality. With a strong bassline and an almost carefree melody, its a track I listen to when I just want to lose myself to dance.</p>
